== Project Overview

Konnektoren Bevy is a modular Rust library for building educational games and interactive applications using the Bevy engine. It provides reusable plugins and components for input management, theming, responsive UI, screen navigation, and settings, with a focus on cross-platform compatibility and extensibility.

== Current State

Based on the codebase, the library:

* Uses Bevy 0.16 for game engine and rendering
* Provides modular plugins for input, theme, UI, screens, and settings
* Supports desktop and web platforms (WASM)
* Implements responsive UI components and theming via egui
* Offers reusable screen plugins: splash, about, credits, settings
* Includes a flexible input system supporting keyboard, gamepad, mouse, and touch
* Provides a settings system with categories, types, and persistence
* Enables easy extension and customization via traits and builder patterns
* Includes comprehensive tests for settings and input modules ✓

== Core Requirements

=== 1. User Interface

* *Responsive UI*: Adapts to device type (desktop, tablet, mobile) and orientation
* *Themed Widgets*: Buttons, text, and spinners styled with KonnektorenTheme
* *Screen Plugins*: Splash, About, Credits, and Settings screens with customizable content
* *Navigation*: Support for keyboard/gamepad navigation and manual dismissal
* *Egui Integration*: Uses egui for all UI rendering and interaction

=== 2. Input Management

* *Input Plugin*: Centralized input management for keyboard, gamepad, mouse, and touch
* *Device Assignment*: Assign input devices to players, prevent conflicts
* *Keyboard Schemes*: Support for WASD, Arrow Keys, IJKL, and custom layouts
* *Gamepad Support*: D-Pad and analog stick input, deadzone configuration
* *Input Events*: Emit events for movement, actions, and device changes
* *Input Configuration UI*: Interactive screen for assigning devices to players
* *Auto Assignment*: Automatically assign available devices to players if enabled

=== 3. Theming

* *Theme Resource*: KonnektorenTheme provides shared colors and styles for UI and egui
* *Customizable*: Theme builder for custom colors, radius, and border width
* *Consistent Styling*: All UI elements use theme colors for visual consistency
* *Status Colors*: Info, success, warning, and error colors for feedback

=== 4. Settings Management

* *Settings Plugin*: Core system for defining, updating, and persisting settings
* *Categories*: Organize settings into categories (audio, graphics, etc.)
* *Setting Types*: Toggle, range (int/float), selection, text, custom
* *Settings UI*: Screen-based and component-based settings screens
* *Events*: Emit events on setting changes for reactive updates
* *Persistence*: Store and retrieve settings across sessions (planned)
* *Extensible*: Builder and trait-based API for adding new settings

=== 5. Screens and Navigation

* *Splash Screen*: Configurable logo, title, subtitle, duration, and transitions
* *About Screen*: Customizable sections, features, technologies, and links
* *Credits Screen*: Team members, assets, special thanks, and technologies
* *Settings Screen*: Audio, graphics, input, and gameplay settings
* *Input Configuration*: Assign devices to players interactively
* *Dismissal*: Manual and automatic screen transitions

=== 6. Technical Requirements

* *Cross-Platform*: Desktop and web (WASM) support
* *Performance*: Efficient systems for input and UI updates
* *Modular Plugins*: Each feature is a Bevy plugin for easy integration
* *Reflection*: Uses Bevy reflection for components/resources where needed
* *Testing*: Unit tests for settings and input modules ✓
* *Documentation*: Inline docs and trait-based API for extensibility

== Feature Roadmap

=== Phase 1: Core Plugin Implementation (Current Phase)

* Implement input plugin with device assignment and events ✓
* Provide theme resource and egui integration ✓
* Develop responsive UI components and widgets ✓
* Add splash, about, credits, and settings screen plugins ✓
* Implement settings system with categories and types ✓
* Add input configuration UI for device assignment ✓
* Write unit tests for input and settings modules ✓

=== Phase 2: Content and Extensibility

* Expand settings categories (gameplay, accessibility, etc.)
* Add localization support for UI labels
* Enable persistent storage of settings and input configuration
* Provide more screen types (e.g., profile, achievements)
* Add more keyboard/gamepad schemes and device detection

=== Phase 3: Polish and Integration

* Optimize UI for mobile/touch devices
* Add advanced navigation (focus, tabbing, controller support)
* Improve theme customization and dynamic switching
* Enhance input configuration with live device detection
* Integrate with external data sources for content/screens

== Technical Architecture

* *Game Engine*: Bevy 0.16
* *UI Framework*: egui via bevy_egui
* *Theme System*: KonnektorenTheme resource, EguiThemePlugin
* *Input System*: InputPlugin, InputController, InputDeviceAssignment, InputSettings
* *Settings System*: SettingsPlugin, Setting components, builders, and events
* *Screen System*: SplashPlugin, AboutPlugin, CreditsPlugin, SettingsScreenPlugin
* *Responsive UI*: ResponsiveInfo resource, responsive widgets
* *Extensibility*: Traits for easy plugin/screen/widget setup

== Constraints and Considerations

* *Performance*: UI and input systems must be efficient for real-time apps
* *Accessibility*: Responsive design and keyboard/gamepad navigation
* *Cross-Platform*: Must work on desktop and web (WASM)
* *Extensibility*: API should allow easy addition of new screens, settings, input types
* *Data Privacy*: Minimize personal data collection
* *Testing*: Maintain high test coverage for core modules ✓

== Success Criteria

* Developers can integrate plugins with minimal setup
* UI adapts responsively to device and orientation
* Input devices can be assigned and managed without conflicts
* Settings can be defined, updated, and queried via API
* Screens are customizable and reusable for different apps
* All core modules have passing unit tests ✓

== Future Considerations

* Persistent storage for settings and input configuration
* Localization and multi-language UI support
* Advanced accessibility features (screen reader, high contrast)
* More screen types (profile, achievements, leaderboard)
* Integration with external APIs for content and user data
* Community-contributed themes and screen templates
